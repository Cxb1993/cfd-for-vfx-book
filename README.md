cfd-for-vfx-book
================

Learn to implement your own CFD solver! A open source book about Computational Fluid Dynamics for Visual Effects.

Currently I am reworking this book and focusing more on practial examples and "how to" implementations of some well received papers. As soon as this process is finished I will release the book. **Until then you can find the latest version with tons of errors and WIPs [here](https://github.com/vfx-engineering/cfd-for-vfx-book/blob/master/latest_version.pdf?raw=true).**

This book is structured into five major parts, which are inspired by the idea of David Marr's *Levels of Analysis*.

1. Introduction
2. Physical Level
3. Mathematical Level
4. Numerical Level
5. Implementational Level
6. Examples

================

Learn to implement your own CFD solver! A open source book about Computational Fluid Dynamics for Visual Effects.

Currently I am reworking this book and focusing more on practial examples and "how to" implementations of some well received papers.

This book is structured into five major parts, which are inspired by the idea of David Marr's *Levels of Analysis*.

1. Introduction
2. Physical Level
3. Mathematical Level
4. Numerical Level
5. Implementational Level
6. Examples

\extrachap{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank first and foremost my little brother Jayanthan for reading and correcting
this book. Coming from the realms of Philosophy it can be quite difficult to read through higher level
mathematical descriptions. Also I want to thank Ken Thomson and Dennis Ritchie, who passed away 2011. Both of them were very inspiring to me and led me to pursuit my passion in computer science.
